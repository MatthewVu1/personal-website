    <h2>by Matthew Vu</h2>
    <p>I'm going to assume that the paragraph doens't exactly have to be formal 
        <br>so I will begin here. I was born in Surrey B.C, Canada. I've spent most of
        <br>my life here, except for a brief stint of education in California.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a list of 3 of my courses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ACIT-1620 Fundamental Web Technologies</li>
        <li>ACIT-1515 Scripting for IT</li>
