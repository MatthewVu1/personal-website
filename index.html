    <h2>Paragraph about me</h2>
    <p>I'm going to assume that the paragraph doesn't exactly have to be formal 
        <br>so I will begin here. I was born in Surrey B.C, Canada. I've spent most of
        <br>my life here, except for a brief stint of education in California. My life
        <br>so far hasn't been the most spectacular, but it is interesting none the less.
        <br>I have a <strong><em>very</em></strong> keen interest in history beinning around the 1900s to
        <br>the early 2000s. I also enjoy a bit of editing with adobe photoshop and premier,
        <br>and of course I also enjoy a bit of video games. Other than that I don't
        <br>have much else to say so i'll end it here.
